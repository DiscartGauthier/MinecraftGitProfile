# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! This project accepts contributions under a **DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)**
and a **PR‑only workflow** (no public modified forks).

## Quick rules
1. Keep your fork **private** while you work. Publish changes only as a **Pull Request** to this repo.
2. Sign your commits with `-s` (DCO):  
   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "Your message"
   ```
3. By opening a PR, you agree your contribution is licensed under this repository’s license.
4. Don’t include third‑party assets unless their licenses are compatible and clearly documented.

## Development
- Keep changes focused and add a short rationale in the PR description.
- If you touch UI, include a screenshot or GIF.
- Run basic checks (lint/format) if available.

## Code of conduct
Be respectful. Maintainers may close PRs that don’t align with the project scope or quality standards.
